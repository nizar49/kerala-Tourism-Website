          Malika (or Puthen Malika) Palace, adorned with carved horses and displaying collections related to 
          the Travancore royal family, whose regional capital was here from the 18th–20th centuries.

 The Museum is grounds to the Trivandrum Zoo, one of the oldest zoological gardens in India. The zoo was established in 1857 over 55 acres (220,000 m2) of land.[2] It also contains the Sree Chitra Art Gallery, a separate art gallery established in 1935.
The set of museums, along with the zoo, are managed by the Department of Museums and Zoos, a branch of
the Department of Cultural Affairs of Kerala.A building was constructed in 1857 during the reign of Uthram Thirunal Marthanda Varma,[3] and later demolished in 1874 to lay foundation for a new building, during the reign of Ayilyam Thirunal.[4]
The Governor of Madras in 1872 appointed Robert Chisholm, a consulting architect of the Madras Government to design a new museum. In 1880, construction finished and the museum opened to the public, bearing the namesake of its governor, Francis Napier, 10th Lord Napier.
