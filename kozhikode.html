        Kozhikode is a coastal city in the south Indian state of Kerala. It was a significant spice trade 
        center and is close to Kappad Beach, where Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed in 1498. The 
        central Kozhikode Beach, overlooked by an old lighthouse, is a popular spot for watching the sunset. 
        Inland, tree-lined Mananchira Square, with its musical fountain, surrounds the massive Mananchira 
        Tank, an artificial pond.

 <b><i><ins>Kappad;</ins></i></b>
 A stone monument installed by government commemorates the "landing" by Vasco da Gama with the inscription, 
 'Vasco da Gama landed here, Kappakadavu, in the year 1498'.
In 2007 a Rs. 1.5 crore program to beautify the beach was launched by [Kerala] Tourism Minister Kodiyeri
 Balakrishnan. It is now completed and Kappad beach has a corniche and park. The park includes a restroom,
  restaurant and seating.
The nearest major railway station is Koyilandy, about 10 km away from Kappad. The nearest airport is Calicut
 International Airport (CCJ), which is about 25 km from the town of Kozhikode. Private transport buses are 
 available from the main bus stand, or visitors can reach the beach by stopping at Thiruvangoor on National 
 Highway 66 between Kozhikode and Vadakara. It is a Blue Flag beach.

<b><i><ins>Kozhikode Beach ;</ins></i></b>

Kozhikode Beach is the personification of the numerous characteristics that make Kozhikode so unique.
People flock in large numbers to view the sunset from the beach. One gets a fresh supply of seafood in
 the shacks that surround the place. Kallumekaya (mussels) is a local favourite. A walk to Dolphins Point at
  dawn ensures a meeting with playful dolphins. You are also greeted by a majestic lighthouse and two piers
   opening into the sea. Both have been here for over a hundred years. Children flock to Lions Park and the
    nearby marine water aquarium which is open on all days from 08:00 hrs to 20:00 hrs.
