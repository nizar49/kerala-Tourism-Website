    <div class="discribe">
      The ancient Tamil works of the Sangam Age record that the area covering the district was part of 
      Puzhinadu which consists of the coastal belt from Kozhikode to Mangalore. Politically the area was part
      of the Ezhimala Kingdom with its capital at Ezhimala in present-day Kannur district. The most famous 
      king of Ezhimala was Nannan whose kingdom extended up to Gudalur and northern parts of Coimbatore. 
      Poozhinad, along with Karkanad which included the eastern regions of Ezhimala dynasty (Wayanad-Gudalur
      region with some portions of Kodagu), had its capital at Ezhimala. The Mooshaka kings were considered 
      descendants of Nannan. By the 14th century, Mooshaka Kingdom was known as Kolathirinad and the rulers
      as Kolathiris. The Kolathunad Kingdom at the peak of its power reportedly extended from Netravati 
      River (Mangalore) in the north[14] to Korapuzha (Kozhikode) in the south with Arabian Sea on the west
      and Kodagu hills on the eastern boundary, also including the isolated islands of Lakshadweep in 
       Arabian Sea.

 <b><i><ins>Bekal Fort ;</ins></i></b>
 The fort appears to emerge from the sea. Almost three-quarters of its exterior is in contact with water. 
 Bekal fort was not an administrative centre and does not include any palaces or mansions.
An important feature is the water-tank, magazine and the flight of steps leading to an observation tower 
built by Tipu Sultan.[1] Standing at the centre of the fort, this offers views of the coastline and the towns
 of Kanhangad, Pallikkara, Bekal, Mavval, Kottikkulam, and Uduma.
The fort's zigzag entrance and surrounding trenches reveal its defensive strategy. Holes on the outer walls 
are designed to defend the fort effectively from naval attacks. The upper holes meant for aiming at the 
farthest targets; lower holes below for striking as enemy nearer and the lowest holes to attacking enemy 
closest to the fort.[2]

Its solid construction resembles the Thalassery Fort and the St. Angelo Fort at Kannur built by the Dutch .

<b><i><ins>Malik Dinar Mosque;</ins></i></b>

It is the site of one of the mosques believed to have been founded by Malik Dinar. According to Qissat 
Shakarwati Farmad, the mosques at Kodungallur, Kollam, Madayi, Barkur, Mangalore, Kasaragod, Kannur, 
Dharmadam, Panthalayini, and Chaliyam, were built during the era of Malik Dinar, and they are among the

<b><i><ins>Ananthapadmanabhaswamy Temple;</ins></i></b>
Ananthapadmanabhaswamy Temple or Ananthapura Lake Temple is a Hindu temple built in the middle of a lake in the little village of Ananthapura, around 6 km from the town of Kumbla in Manjeshwaram Taluk of Kasaragod District of Kerala, South India. This is the only lake temple in Kerala and is believed to be the original seat (Moolasthanam) of Ananthapadmanabha Swami (Padmanabhaswamy temple)
 Thiruvananthapuram. It is considered one among the 108 Abhimana Kshethram of Vaishnavate tradition. Legend 
 has it that this is the original site where Ananthapadmanabha settled down.[1][2] Babiya, a crocodile who 
 lived in the lake, was also famed for being vegetarian. She died aged 75 on October 9, 2022. It is believed 
 that she ate only temple offerings that were served to her twice a week and never harmed a single human.
The lake in which the sanctum sanctorum is built measures about 2 acres. An interesting spot to keep in mind 
while visiting the temple is a cave to the right corner of the lake. According to the local legend, the deity 
Anantha Padmanabha chose to go all the way to Thiruvananthapuram through that cave. Hence both the places
 retain similar names, in spite of being on either end of the region.
