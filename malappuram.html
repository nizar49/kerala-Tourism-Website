<b><i><ins>Adyanpara Waterfall;</ins></i></b>
Adyanpara Falls is a cascading waterfall in the Kurmbalangodu village of Nilambur taluk in Kerala, India.
 It is 14 kilometres from Nilambur town, and attracts tourists from various parts of Kerala. This is a 
 seasonal waterfall. During Summer, water flow is low.In any case, when it comes to timing a visit for
  waterfalls, you have to know when the rains would normally come. Then, in the transition between rainy 
  and dry, that's where you're likely to get the best of both worlds â€“ drainages likely to have a lot of
   water along with improving (albeit variable) weather.
