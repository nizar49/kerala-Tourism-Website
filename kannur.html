      Kannur is a coastal city in the south Indian state of Kerala. It was once an ancient trading port.
       Enduring monuments such as 16th-century St. Angelo Fort, once occupied by European colonial forces,
        show the city’s significant role in the spice trade. Housed in a former palace, the Arakkal Museum 
        highlights Kerala's one Muslim royal family. The palm-fringed sands of Payyambalam Beach run along 
        Kannur’s western shore.

 <b><i><ins>St. Angelo Fort;</ins></i></b>
 In 1498, during Vasco da Gama's visit to India, the local Kolathiri king granted the land to Portuguese to 
 build a settlement in present-day Kerala. On 23 October 1505, he gave the Portuguese leader Francisco de
  Almeida the permission to build a fort at the site. The construction activity began the very next day, on 
  24 October 1505, when Goncalo Gil Barbosa - the Portuguese factor of Cannanore (Kannur) - laid the 
  foundation stone. The construction of the wooden fort was completed on 30 October 1505: its first Captain 
  was Lourenco Britto, who led a garrison of 150 Portuguese men, and controlled two ships in the sea. After 
  the fort was completed, Almeida began using the title "Viceroy", and in 1507, he started the construction 
  of a stone fort at the site.

<b><i><ins>Arakkal Museum ;</ins></i></b>
The Arakkal Museum is a museum dedicated to the Arakkal family, the only Muslim royal family in Kerala, 
India. The museum is actually a section of the Arakkalkettu (Arakkal Royal Palace). The durbar hall section 
of the palace has been converted into a museum by the Government of Kerala. It was opened in July 2005 after 
a Rs. 9,000,000 renovation.
Although renovated by the government, the Arakkalkettu is still owned by the Arakkal Royal Trust and does not 
fall under the control of the country's archaeology department, the Archaeological Survey of India. The 
government had taken a keen interest in preserving the heritage of the Arakkal Family, which had played a 
prominent role in the history of Malabar. A nominal entry fee is charged by the Arakkal Royal Trust from 
visitors to the museum.
