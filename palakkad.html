 <b><i><ins>Palakkad Fort;</ins></i></b>
 The Palakkad Fort is said to have existed from very ancient times but believed to be constructed in the 
 present form in 1766 A.D, but little is known of its early history. The local ruler, Palakkad Achchan, was 
 originally a tributary of the Zamorin but had become independent before the beginning of the eighteenth 
 century.[1] In 1757 he sent a deputation to Hyder Ali seeking help against an invasion threatened by the 
 Zamorin. Hyder Ali seized upon the opportunity to gain possession of a strategically important location 
 such as Palghat and from that time until 1790 the fort was continually in the hands of the Mysore Sultans 
 or the British. It was first taken by the latter in 1768 when Colonel Wood captured it during his raid on 
 Hyder Ali's fortresses, but it was retaken by Hyder a few months later. It was recaptured by Colonel 
 Fullarton in 1783, after a siege that lasted eleven days but was abandoned the following year.
