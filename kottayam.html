    <div class="discribe">
        Kottayam is a city in the Indian state of Kerala, flanked by the Western Ghats on the east and 
        the Vembanad Lake and paddy fields of Kuttanad on the west.[1] It is the district headquarters 
        of Kottayam district, located in south-west Kerala. Kottayam is located in the basin of the Meenachil
         River at an average elevation of 3 metres (9.8 ft) above sea level, and has a moderate climate. It 
         is located approximately 155 kilometres (96 mi) north of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram.
        Kottayam is also referred to as "The City of Letters" as many of the first Malayalam daily newspapers, 
         like Deepika, Malayala Manorama, and Mangalam, were started and are headquartered in Kottayam, as are a 
        number of publishing houses.From the beginning of the ninth century AD, the history of Thekkumkur and 
        of Kottayam are virtually indistinguishable. Kottayam was then a part of Vempolinad, an area in the 
        Kulashekara Empire (800 AD – 1103  AD). By 1103, the Kingdom of Vempolinad had split into the Kingdoms
         of Thekkumkur and Vadakkumkur, and the latter became a vassal of Cochin.[5][6]
